Endpoints for the world's most impactful data scattered across the online and offline worlds.

## Goal
Finding good data sources in many research domains is often time consuming. Even when we do know a good source exists, it's difficult to navigate through it. Or sometimes, those sources don't actually cover all the data that is available out there. Let's collect all major data sources in variety of research fields (ie. Life Sciences, Metallurgy, and Finance) & create a frictionless and easy access via an API. 

## Who Should Contribute?
If you are a researcher, a developer, or just an interested individual who regularly makes use of variety of data sources in research domains, you might be just the right person. Particularly if you often have trouble finding good sources or navigating through the sources. Help us solve the data accessibility problem!


## How to Contribute?
You can contributes in 2 ways.
1) Send us the sources: If you know where the data is & want to help others discover it too, then please help us keep track of those sources!
2) Build endpoints for us: If you want to help design easier ways to interact with data, then please help us build th endpoints!

### Workflow
Each source will go through a simple 3 step process to keep track of our status.

Source Idenitification -> Source Validation -> Endpoint Design

#### Source Identification
You'll see under directory /unverified_sources

#### Source Validation
Whether you're  please make sure they are impactful enough and valid.
1) Impact: Does this data have commercial, academic, or public value? Does this data contain actually useful information? Can you back up the value by citing actual use cases on who used this data, how, and what for?
2) Validity: Is the data indeed what it says it is?

## Data Domains
The below are domains suffering from data scattering problem. Please feel free to suggest new domains/subdomains.
